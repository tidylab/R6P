Description: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design 
    patterns in R. Design patterns abstract and present in neat, well-defined 
    components and interfaces the experience of many software designers and 
    architects over many years of solving similar problems. These are solutions 
    that have withstood the test of time with respect to re-usability,
    flexibility, and maintainability. 'R6P' provides abstract base classes with 
    examples for a few known design patterns. The patterns were selected by 
    their applicability to analytic projects in R. Using these patterns in R 
    projects have proven effective in dealing with the complexity that 
    data-driven applications possess.
