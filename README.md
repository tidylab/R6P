Introduction
------------

Design patterns abstract and present in neat, well-defined components
and interfaces the experience of many software designers and architects
over many years of solving similar problems. These are solutions that
have withstood the test of time with respect to re-usability,
flexibility, and maintainability. R6P provides abstract base classes
with examples for a few known design patterns. The patterns were
selected by their applicability to analytic projects in R. Using these
patterns in R projects have proven effective in dealing with the
complexity that data-driven applications possess.

This package is based on the work of Gamma1995, and Fowler2002.
