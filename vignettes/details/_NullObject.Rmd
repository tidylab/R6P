```{r, include = FALSE}
source(file.path(usethis::proj_get(), "vignettes",  "_common.R"))
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
events$stop_not_useful("NullObject")
```

<!-- One line about what the function does -->

***Null Object*** provides special behaviour for particular cases.

```{r warning=TRUE}
warning("The Null Object is not the same as the reserved word in R `NULL` (all caps).")
```

## How It Works

When a function fails in R, some functions produce a run-time error while others
return `NULL` (and potentially prompt a warning). What the function evokes in
case of a failure is subjected to its programmer discretion. Usually, the
programmer follows either a punitive or forgiving policy regarding how run-time
errors should be handled.

In other occasions, `NULL` is often the result of unavailable data. This could
happened when querying a data source matches no entries, or when the system is
waiting for user input (mainly in Shiny).

If it is possible for a function to return `NULL` rather than an error, then it
is important to surround it with null test code, e.g.
`if(is.null(...)) do_the_right_thing()`. This way the software would do the
right thing if a null is present.

Often the right thing is the same in many contexts, so you end up writing
similar code in lots of placesâ€”committing the sin of code duplication.

Instead of returning `NULL`, or some odd value such as `NaN` or `logical(0)`,
return a **Null Object** that has the same interface as what the caller expects.
In R, this often means returning a `data.frame` structure, i.e. column names and
variables types, with no rows.

## When to Use It

-   In situations when a subroutine is likely to fail, such as loss of Internet
    or database connectivity. Instead of prompting a run-time error, you could
    return the **Null Object** as part of a [gracefully
    failing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_exit) strategy. A common
    strategy employs `tryCatch` that returns the **Null Object** in the case of
    an error:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Simulate a database that is 5% likely to fail 
read_mtcars <- function() if(runif(1) < 0.05) stop() else return(mtcars)

# mtcars null object constructor
NullCar <- function() mtcars[0,]

# How does the null car object look like? 
NullCar()

# Subroutine with gracefully failing strategy
set.seed(1814)
cars <- tryCatch(
  # Try reading the mtcars dataset
  read_mtcars(), 
  # If there is an error, return the Null Car object
  error = function(e) return(NullCar()) 
)

# Notice: Whether the subroutine fails or succeeds, it returns a tibble with 
# the same structure.
colnames(cars)
```

-   In Shiny dashboards

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
geom_null <- function(...){
  ggplot2::ggplot() + ggplot2::geom_blank() + ggplot2::theme_void()
}

if(exists("user_input")){
  ggplot2::ggplot(user_input, ggplot::aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) + ggplot2::geom_point()
} else {
  geom_null() + geom_text(aes(0,0), label = "choose an entry from the list")
}
```

-   In unit-tests

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
classes <- function(x) sapply(x, class)
    
test_that("mtcars follows a certain table structure", {
    # Compare column names
    expect_identical(colnames(mtcars), colnames(NullCar()))
    # Compare variable types
    expect_identical(classes(mtcars), classes(NullCar()))
})
```
