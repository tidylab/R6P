<!-- One line about what the function does -->

***Singleton*** ensures a class only has one instance, and provide a global
point of access to it.

## How It Works

1.  Create only one instance of the **Singleton** class; and
2.  If an instance exists, then serve the same object again.

The main features of **Singleton** are:

-   Ensuring that one and only one object of the class gets created;

-   Providing an access point for an object that is global to the program; and

-   Controlling concurrent access to resources that are shared.

## When to Use It

-   In situations that require exactly one instance of a class, that must be
    accessible to clients from a well-known access point. See the [`Counter`
    example](#example-1).

```{r, error=TRUE}
stop("Singletons can be a problem in multi-threaded applications, especially when they manipulate mutable data.")
```

```{r, message=TRUE}
message("Singletons work well for immutable data, such as reading from some data source, since anything that can’t change isn’t going to run into thread clash problems.")
```

## Example: Counter {#example-1}

In this example we implement a `Counter` that inherits the qualities of
**Singleton**.

```{r Singleton-Counter-implementation, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
Counter <<- R6::R6Class(inherit = Singleton, public = list(
    count = 0,
    add_1 = function(){self$count = self$count + 1; invisible(self)}
))
```

Whenever we call the constructor on `Counter`, we always get the exact same
instance:

```{r Singleton-instantiation, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
counter_A <- Counter$new()
counter_B <- Counter$new()

sprintf("counter_A was crated at %s", pryr::address(counter_A))
sprintf("counter_B was crated at %s", pryr::address(counter_B))

identical(counter_A, counter_B)
```

The two objects are equal and located at the same address; thus, they are the
same object.

When we make a change in any of the class instances, the rest of the instances
are changed as well.

```{r Singleton-Counter-instantiation, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# How many times has the counter been increased?
counter_A$count

# Add the counter by 1
counter_A$add_1()

# How many times has the counter been increased?
counter_A$count
counter_B$count 
```

## Example: Data Transfer Object (DTO)

In this example, we crate access to a database that only establishes one
connection per session.

Notice how the `initialize` public method first calls the `initialize` of the
**Singleton**, and then appends its own initialisation routine.

```{r Singleton-DTO-implementation, echo=TRUE, results='hold', eval=TRUE}
DTO <<- R6::R6Class(classname = "DTO", inherit = Singleton, public = list(
    con = NULL,
    initialize = function(){
        super$initialize()
        self$establish_connection()
    },
    establish_connection = function(){
        self$con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = ":memory:")
        return(self)
    },
    dbSendQuery = function(statement){
        res <- DBI::dbSendQuery(self$con, statement)
        return(res)
    }
))
```

Once a database connection has established during the session, other calls to
`DTO` instantiate objects that use the same database connection.

```{r Singleton-DTO-instantiation, echo=TRUE, results='markup', eval=TRUE}
database_A <- DTO$new()
database_B <- DTO$new()
identical(database_A, database_B)
```
