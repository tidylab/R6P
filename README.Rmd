## Introduction

`r read.dcf("DESCRIPTION", "Description")[[1]]`

This package is based on the work of Gamma1995, and Fowler2002.

### Should I use design patterns?

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Design patterns represent an alternative to design: rather than designing a new mechanism from scratch, just apply a well-known design pattern. For the most part, this is good: design patterns arose because they solve common problems, and because they are generally agreed to provide clean solutions. If a design pattern works well in a particular situation, it will probably be hard for you to come up with a different approach that is better.
:::

::: {.alert .alert-warning}
The greatest risk with design patterns is over-application. Not every problem can be solved cleanly with an existing design pattern; don’t try to force a problem into a design pattern when a custom approach will be cleaner. Using design patterns doesn’t automatically improve a software system; it only does so if the design patterns fit. As with many ideas in software design, the notion that design patterns are good doesn’t necessarily mean that more design patterns are better.
